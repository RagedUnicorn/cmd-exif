# cmd-exif

A lightweight Python project to read EXIF data from images.

## Features
- Extract detailed EXIF metadata from image files.
- Simple and easy-to-use Python script.
- Compatible with most image file types that store EXIF data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cmd-exif.git
   cd cmd-exif
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   Using IntelliJ:
    - Open the project in IntelliJ.
    - Navigate to `File > Project Structure > Modules` and set up a virtual environment.

   Or, create one manually:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project
You can use IntelliJâ€™s run configuration to execute the script. Make sure to set the path to the image you want to analyze in the script or as a command-line argument.

Alternatively, run the script directly from the command line:
```bash
python main.py --image /path/to/your/image.jpg
```

## Usage
1. Ensure your image file is accessible.
2. Run the script using IntelliJ or the command line.
3. View the extracted EXIF data in the output.
